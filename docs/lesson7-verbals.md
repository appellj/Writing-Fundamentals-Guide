# Lesson 7: Verbals

Most of us are familiar with verbs. They describe the action or state of being. For example: 

> I **run**. 

(“I” is the subject, “run” is the verb) 

> They **crashed**. 

(“They” is the subject, “crashed” is the verb) 

> I **think**, therefore I **am**. 

(“I” is the subject in each clause, “think” and “am” are the verbs) 

> The plane **is flying** overhead. 

(“plane” is the subject, “flying” is the verb preceded by the helper verb “is”)

But sometimes, a verb is not a verb!

A **verbal** is a word formed from a verb that functions as a noun, adjective, or adverb. There are three types of verbals:

* Gerunds
* Participles
* Infinitives

## Gerunds
**Gerunds** end in “-ing” and act as a **noun**:

> **Flying** is my favorite pastime. 

(“Flying” is the subject of the sentence) 

> I love **running**. 

(“running” is the direct object of the sentence)
## Participles
**Participles** act as **adjectives**. There are two types of participles: **present** and **past**. 

**Present participles**, like gerunds, end in **“-ing”**, but they’re used as adjectives, not nouns:

> The **flying** squirrel was amazing. 

(“flying” is an adjective modifying “squirrel”) 

> The squirrel **flying across the sky** was amazing. 

(“flying across the sky” is a present participial phrase acting as an adjective modifying “squirrel”)

**Past participles** usually end in **“-ed”** or **“-en”**:

The **crashed** server made us frantic. 
(“crashed” is an adjective modifying “server”) 

The **broken** windows leaked a lot of rain. 
(“broken” is an adjective modifying “windows”)

Don’t confuse gerunds and present participles with verbs in the progressive tense, which come after a form of the verb “to be”:

> The plane **is flying** overhead. (verb) 

> The cat **was running** across the lawn. (verb)

Don’t confuse past participles with verbs in the passive voice, which start with was/were:

> The windshield **was cracked**. (verb) 

> The windows **were broken**. (verb)
## Infinitives
**Infinitives start with “to”** and end with the simple present form of a verb, such as “to fly” and “to crack”. They can act as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.
### Nouns
> **To live** is **to adjust**. 

> I want **to go**. 

> I love **to fly**.

### Adjectives
> This is the best time **to start**. 

(modifies “time”) 

> The first attempt **to build the Panama Canal** ended in failure. 

(adjectival infinitive phrase modifying “attempt”)

### Adverbs
You know an infinitive is acting as an adverb if you can put “in order” in front of it and get the same meaning.

> **To win**, you need the highest number of points. 

(adverb modifying “need”) 

> **In order to win**, you need the highest number of points. 

(same thing) 

> We nailed plywood on the store windows **to prepare for the storm**. 

(adverbial infinitive phrase modifying “nailed”). 

> We nailed plywood on the store windows **in order to prepare for the storm**. 

(same thing)

If you look at the noun or adjective examples of infinitives, however, you can’t put “in order” in front of them and get the same meaning. “I love in order to fly” doesn’t have the same meaning as “I love to fly”, so you know in this case the infinitive is not an adverb.

Note that you use a comma after the adverbial infinitive when it **starts** a sentence:

> **To prepare for the storm,** we nailed plywood on the store windows.

But you do not separate the adverbial infinitive from the rest of the sentence if it comes at the **end** of the sentence:

> We nailed plywood on the store windows **to prepare for the storm**.

Don’t confuse infinitives with prepositional phrases. In infinitives, “to” is followed by a verb, whereas in prepositions “to” is followed by a noun.

> I want **to go**. 

(Infinitive - “to” is followed by the verb “go”) 

> I went **to the park**. 

(Prepositional phrase - “to” is followed by the noun “(the) park”)

So that’s all you really need to know about verbals. And now I’m **guessing** (verb) you want **to go** (infinitive) **to the bar** (prepositional phrase) and forget all about them. 
## Summary
* Verbals are verbs that act like other parts of speech. 
* Gerunds end in -ing and are nouns.
* Present participles end in -ing but are adjectives. 
* Past participles end in -ed or -en and act as adjectives. 
* Infinitive start with “to” and can be nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.
